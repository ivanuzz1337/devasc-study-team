Hello! I'm Abyzov Ivan.

3. Third task was about Docker. Docker - it is programm, that can start another programm in container - isolated process. (Like a VM, but they not the same)
● Task name => Docker

    ● Image of VM "DEVASC_VM" - VM for experiments;
    ● Docker guide from digitalocean.com and https://www.docker.com/

● Task troubleshooting => There were not any problem.

I had had some problems with push my results in GitHub. But after a while I figured out how to act correctly, and now it's clear.
